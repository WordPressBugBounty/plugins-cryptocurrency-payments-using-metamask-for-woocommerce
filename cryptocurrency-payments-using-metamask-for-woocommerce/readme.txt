### Key Features

* **MetaMask Payment Integration:** Enable customers to pay using the MetaMask browser extension or mobile app. At checkout, users can connect their MetaMask wallet and complete transactions directly from their device, fast, secure, and decentralized.

* **Multi‑Wallet Support:** The plugin also supports WalletConnect, Binance Wallet, and other Web3-compatible wallets, ensuring your store is accessible to a broader audience of crypto users, no matter which wallet app or device they prefer.

* **Multi‑Chain Support:** Accept payments across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum (ERC-20), Binance Smart Chain (BEP-20), Polygon (MATIC), and Avalanche.

* **Custom EVM-compatible chains:** You can assign wallet addresses for each supported chain, enabling seamless multichain payment processing.

* **Custom ERC‑20/BEP‑20 Tokens:** Easily add your ERC‑20 or BEP‑20 tokens and accept them as payment. You can set a fixed fiat price for each token or let the plugin calculate pricing dynamically based on real-time market rates.

* **Real-Time Fiat-to-Crypto Pricing:** Display your WooCommerce product prices in fiat currencies (USD, EUR, INR, and more). The plugin automatically converts prices to cryptocurrency using live exchange rates at the moment of checkout, ensuring transparent and accurate transactions.

* **Testnet Support:** Enable test mode and simulate transactions using popular testnets like Goerli, Sepolia, Polygon Mumbai, BSC Testnet, and Avalanche Fuji. Perfect for developers or store owners who want to test their setup before going live.

* **On‑Chain Refunds:** Initiate refunds in cryptocurrency directly from your WooCommerce order page. Refunds are processed securely on-chain via your connected Web3 wallet, providing a transparent and reliable experience for you and your customers.

* **Multiple Payment Addresses:** Assign separate wallet addresses for each blockchain network you support. For example, use one address for Ethereum payments and another for Binance Smart Chain. 

* **Transaction Tracking Dashboard:** View a detailed log of all crypto payments made through your store. The dashboard displays order ID, network, token used, sender wallet address, transaction status, and more, helping you stay on top of your Web3 sales activity.

* **Token‑Based Discounts:** Encourage adoption of your preferred tokens by offering automatic discounts when customers use specific tokens at checkout. Ideal for promoting community coins or incentivizing certain payment methods.

* **Crypto‑Wallet Login (Web3 Authentication):** Let customers log in or register using their crypto wallet. With Web3 login, users authenticate via MetaMask or WalletConnect, no password required. This simplifies the login experience and enhances privacy and security.
